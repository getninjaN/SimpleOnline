This is the first mod that I've made from scratch and was originally made for a server that I administrate.
It is a simple mod allowing players to list other players and what world they're in.


Usage
/online - Lists all players on the server and what world they are in.
This skips the worlds that are empty.
/online will output:
Online in "world1": player1 player2 player3
Online in "world2": player4 player5


/online [world name] - Lists all players on server in the world entered
If there are no online players in the world provided the player will get a message saying that there are no players online in that world.

/online [world name] will output:
Online in "world name": player4 player5

If the world isn't found the player will be getting a message saying that the world couldn't be found.

There's a configuration file generated for color changing and translation of the messages.
